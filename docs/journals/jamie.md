We began the day using trello to determine what tasks were top priority.  There was a bug found within the movie detail page that when an image was clicked the wrong movie detail page was shown.  The movie url needed to be split with the slash and the fifth item used to extract the appropriate data to be displayed in the browser.  A lot of fetching and merging was done today to the frontend branch and our own making it easier to get the operational flow down.  We added the movie image, title, year, and rating to the movie list page.  We also created the link that directs to the movie detail page.  Pagination was explored towards the end of the day and will be continued into tomorrow.

Today we broke off into our frontend and backend teams.  First, used trello to determine what our main goals for the day were and place those in the appropriate categories.  Once our goal were decided, we each created our own personal branches to work on as well as a frontend branch for each of us to merge our branches to.  By creating the frontend branch, it allowed us to each shared our commits within the frontend team and not push directly to the main branch until okayed.  Together we collaborated and recreated all files needed for our ghi and solved an issue of the index.js not finding babbel.  I noticed the issue was that there were duplicate scr, public, and node_module files.  After deleting ones within the app folder, it seemed to correct the issue for two of us and the website worked.  The next step was to get the movie detail page working which Sheldon was able to find a solution for.  The main takeaway from today was becoming more familiar with checking out different branches, pushing, and merging changes from other branches.
