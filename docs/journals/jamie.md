Today we broke off into our frontend and backend teams.  First, used trello to determine what our main goals for the day were and place those in the appropriate categories.  Once our goal were decided, we each created our own personal branches to work on as well as a frontend branch for each of us to merge our branches to.  By creating the frontend branch, it allowed us to each shared our commits within the frontend team and not push directly to the main branch until okayed.  Together we collaborated and recreated all files needed for our ghi and solved an issue of the index.js not finding babbel.  I noticed the issue was that there were duplicate scr, public, and node_module files.  After deleting ones within the app folder, it seemed to correct the issue for two of us and the website worked.  The next step was to get the movie detail page working which Sheldon was able to find a solution for.  The main takeaway from today was becoming more familiar with checking out different branches, pushing, and merging changes from other branches.
