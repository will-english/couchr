Edward and I did some paired programing on our list views. I created a signup feature, 
but I'm still having issues with the logout giving me a 403 error but its getting closer.
## 8/23
We created our branches, Edward and I connected the new django project to the postgres 
database. I spent a lot of the day working on the authentication but Zach and I found
and issue with the cookbook, so that will get put on the backburner until it gets fixed.

We went in and recreated the main application, we needed to do this so that everyone 
was caught up and on the same page. This past weekend I worked a lot on the user auth 
service and was able to make a little bit of progress this morning. We are going to go 
over our group process for pushing/pulling and after that we should have a good work-
flow going forward.

Today we worked on getting the base files for the react app set up so that the members 
working on the front end could start coding. I had a lot of issues with docker today 
but by the end of the day with the help of the seirs and teammates we got a base set up 
working. We have a lot of different branchesgoing at the moment and we will probably 
need to be pruning those off in the futureonce we have a better understanding of our 
project workflow.
## 8/18:
We discussed the neccessary models for the project and removed the movie model in place
of just the movie_vo model. I spent time today reading and looking at resources to 
create the user authenication feature of the application. I helped with a couple of 
blockers related to setting up the codebase.
