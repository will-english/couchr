Today felt productive. We switched our third party api a couple of times and I think this time we all agree this is the best one. Jamie and I collaborated to create a logo for the project and finished up the mockups and put them in the ghi mark down files. We hit a bit of a blocker getting the react to work with our docker compose but hopefully tomorrows lesson will help us fix any issues left. We also agreed on some possible color schemes and I am looking forward to creating React pages from our third party API.
