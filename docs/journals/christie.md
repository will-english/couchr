Today was much better! We used the project advice on learn to completely rebuild our project. Will spent a lot of time over the weekend reviewing the material and was able to walk us through what each step did. We did hit a blocker when it wouldn't build properly on all of our computers but Dalonte and Zack were readily available to help us out. Now we plan to work on our git pushing and fetching and merging to avoid conflicts in the future.

Today was tough. I don't feel that I contributed much today as we spent all of the day getting everyone's docker and react containers to work. The docker compose is very important so today was necessary, but we did not further the project in any other way.

Today felt productive. We switched our third party api a couple of times and I think this time we all agree this is the best one. Jamie and I collaborated to create a logo for the project and finished up the mockups and put them in the ghi mark down files. We hit a bit of a blocker getting the react to work with our docker compose but hopefully tomorrows lesson will help us fix any issues left. We also agreed on some possible color schemes and I am looking forward to creating React pages from our third party API.
