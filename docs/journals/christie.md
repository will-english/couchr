Today felt very productive. Jamie, Sheldon, and I finally got the continuous loop of rendering to stop and added a carousel of the popular movies to our main page! I gathered a list of everyone's favorite movies and got the corresponding movie id's from our third api and look forward to applying what I learned today into a new carousel of our favorite movies tomorrow!

Today was not as productive as some of our others. We found that the useEffect on our Main Page kept rendering on a continuous loop and couldn't figure out how to stop it. Jamie thought of adding pagination but we are only showing 20 movies so it isn't necessary but it does stop the rendering. We spent hours trying to get the pagination to work but seem to have gotten somewhere! It doesnt solve the entire issue but definitely helps.

Today was a lot of fun trying to figure out the functional React components using hooks. It was cool to use the explorations from over the weekend on our project. We ran into some blockers getting the colummns to populate with our array from the API but I am confident we will figure it out tomorrow!

Today felt very productive. Jamie, Sheldon and I spent the day sharing our screens and working on the frontend. We found that some of the movies didnt have posters from the API so I designed an error picture on Canva that would take it's place for those movies. We made coloums to list the movies in cards and made the cards into links bringing the user to the movie's detail page. One small blocker we met today was when we found a bug in our movie detail page, and realized it was only taking the last number of the url to use as the movie id instead of the entire number so we used the split method on the url using the "/" divider to grab the entire movie id. I feel a lot more comfortable with git branches today and am very happy with our progrress.

Today we worked on creating the React pages. We took a while reading up on how to make detail pages on React with a specific id in the url and we were able to get it started! As well as starting a browse movie page. I worry about using git branches, we seem to spend a lot of day fixing git merge issues but Im sure we will get better as we practice each day.

Today was much better! We used the project advice on learn to completely rebuild our project. Will spent a lot of time over the weekend reviewing the material and was able to walk us through what each step did. We did hit a blocker when it wouldn't build properly on all of our computers but Dalonte and Zack were readily available to help us out. Now we plan to work on our git pushing and fetching and merging to avoid conflicts in the future.

Today was tough. I don't feel that I contributed much today as we spent all of the day getting everyone's docker and react containers to work. The docker compose is very important so today was necessary, but we did not further the project in any other way.

## 8/18/22
Today felt productive. We switched our third party api a couple of times and I think this time we all agree this is the best one. Jamie and I collaborated to create a logo for the project and finished up the mockups and put them in the ghi mark down files. We hit a bit of a blocker getting the react to work with our docker compose but hopefully tomorrows lesson will help us fix any issues left. We also agreed on some possible color schemes and I am looking forward to creating React pages from our third party API.
