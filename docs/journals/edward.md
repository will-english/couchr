### 8/19
 - Zach helped with my view functinos after changing the movie attribute in the List model from a foreign key to a many-to-many relationship
 - m2m relationships are new to me and I had issues passing the data through the encoders, so we ended up updating the views to not use the encoders
 - next steps: need to revise List view's POST function to add multiple movies instead of just 1
### 8/18
 - started models and views for Lists and MovieVOs
 - created fake MovieVOs to test in Insomnia
 - blocker: how to add multiple movies into one list instance?
 - other: not 100% sure how 3rd party API will interact with models/views
