We received our feedback from Dalonte and he provided lots of useful advice, especially advice on user authentication and how to choose a good 3rd party API. We dockerized project and discussed our individual parts. I was focusing on Movies microservice. Christie and Jamie created a logo for our website. It’s amazing and we all like it! Even though we have our own parts, we communicated a lot to ensure everyone is on the same page. I’m glad to be a part of this team.
